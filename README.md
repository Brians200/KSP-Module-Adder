KSP-Module-Adder
================

This program is designed to assist with adding modules that mods create to existing parts, so I don't have to do it by hand. It will automatically generate a Module Manager file with the following additions.

<ul>
<li>MechJeb</li>
<ul><li>Adds it to all command pods, if the dll is present</li></ul>
<li>Protractor</li>
<ul><li>Adds it to all command pods, if the dll is present</li></ul>
<li>Deadly Re-entry</li>
<ul>
<li>Creates a generic rule of setting the max temperature to half its original value</li>
<li>Creates a generic rule of setting the heat production to half its original value on engines</li>
</ul>
