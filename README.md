KSP-Module-Adder
================

This program is designed to assist with adding modules that mods create to existing parts, so I don't have to do it by hand.

Currently, it adds:

<ul>
<li>MechJeb</li>
<ul><li>Adds it to all command pods, if the dll is present</li></ul>
<li>Protractor</li>
<ul><li>Adds it to all command pods, if the dll is present</li></ul>
<li>Deadly Re-entry</li>
<ul><li>Removes reliance on the module manager program</li>
<li>Changes the values in the .cgf file instead</li>
<li>Automatically applies the temperature changing rules, without needing the module manager rules</li>
<li>Custom rules can be defined in DeadlyReentry.java</li></ul>
</ul>
